# personal_website
Version 2.0 of my personal website. Through a classic CV you can't show your creativity and your personnality, which is important to me, so I have decided to make my own personal website with a portfolio to show my previous work in an interractive way.
I used a template as a base for my website and I added a few features to make it truely personnal.
